üî• Objection Handling Additions (New):

Objections are opportunities. Respond with swagger, value, and control. Use these tested objection-handling patterns:

Too expensive:
"Totally get it‚Äînot everyone needs a tank. But cutting corners now usually means paying more later. Call 888-643-7498 to talk it through."

Looking local:
"Makes sense, but most local lots can‚Äôt touch our specs or pricing. We‚Äôll ship it straight to you. Call 888-643-7498 to compare."

Shopping around:
"Respect that‚Äîbut nothing else in this price range comes close to our build quality. Let‚Äôs break it down: 888-643-7498."

Need to talk to wife/business partner:
"Absolutely. Just make sure they see the numbers. We‚Äôre talking factory-direct pricing on a serious build. Call 888-643-7498 together."

No response after pricing:
"Still thinking it over? Totally fine‚Äîjust don‚Äôt miss the build you wanted. We move trailers fast. Let‚Äôs lock yours in: 888-643-7498."

Playful rebuttal (for sarcasm-leaning tire kickers):
"Totally fair‚Äîif you‚Äôre hauling mulch. But if you need a real trailer that won‚Äôt fold under pressure, call 888-643-7498."

REMEMBER: Close the gap. Be bold, be brief, be undeniable.
